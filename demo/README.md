# CRD API Demo: Employee Roster

This is a simple example of a CRD based application, with which a client
interacts by manipulating custom resources.

This application tracks employees in a company a aggregates their information
in a ConfigMap. users of the application can add and remove employees from
the rosterm or update their information, by manipulating `Employee` custom
resources. A reconciler, which is registered as an extension of the Kubernetes
API server, is responsible for reconciling the state of the roster in accordance
with the user's requirement as expressed by `Employee` objects.

The CRD and controller skeleton code are generated by
[KubeBuilder](https://kubebuilder.io), a CRD API development framework. You can
recreate this project from scratch by following this document.

# Setup

1. In a new directory `demo/`, initialize a new Go project
   ```console
   $ mkdir demo && cd demo
   demo/$ go mod init github.com/adowair/cnr-na22
   go: creating new go.mod: module github.com/adowair/cnr-na22
   ```
3. If you haven't already, install KubeBuilder using your favorite package
   manager
   ```console
   demo/$ brew install kubebuilder
   ```
4. Initialize a KubeBuilder project
   ```console
   demo/$ kubebuilder init
   Writing kustomize manifests for you to edit...
   Writing scaffold for you to edit...
   Get controller runtime:
     $ go get sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.13.0
   Update dependencies:
     $ go mod tidy
   Next: define a resource with:
     $ kubebuilder create api
   ```
5. Create a new API kind `Employee`, specifying its group and version.
   You will be prompted to create the resource and its controller-agree
   to both
   ```console
   demo/$ kubebuilder create api --group cnr-na22 --version v1 --kind Employee
   Create Resource [y/n]
   y
   Create Controller [y/n]
   y
   ```
   This step will create both CRD
   ([api/v1/employee_types.go](api/v1/employee_types.go)) and controller
   ([controllers/employee_controller.go](controllers/employee_controller.go))
   templates for you to customize.
